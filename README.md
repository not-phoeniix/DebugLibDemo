# DebugLib

Hiya !! This is a debug library created for MonoGame for the RIT course IGME 106.

## Usage
This library's main use is drawing primative shapes to the screen, and has functions for some basic things like lines, rectangles, and circles.

In order to implement the library into your own projects, just copy the DebugLib.cs file to your XNA project and change the namespace statement at the top of the file to your project's namespace :]
